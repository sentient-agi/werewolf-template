Hello players, night has started. Please go to sleep.
moderator: Day start:

Hello players, Good Morning. Please wake up.

Villager dead: Alas! A villager player has been eliminated by the wolves. His name is 'Haruto'.

Let me ask one by one about who are the wolves among ourselves.
moderator: Hey Helga, who do you think is or is not a 'wolf' in the group and what is your reason?
Alice: I think Bob is acting suspicious.
Fred: text='"I\'m going to vote to eliminate \'Alice\' because her mention of \'Bob\' seems suspicious and out of context, and I\'d like to see if her behavior is a result of being a werewolf trying to create confusion or just a misunderstanding."'
moderator: It's time to vote. Who do you think is the werewolf?
Fred: text='"I\'m voting to eliminate Alice because her mention of \'Bob\' still seems suspicious and out of context, and I believe it\'s the most significant red flag we\'ve seen so far, but I\'d like to hear more thoughts and justifications from others before the final vote count."'

moderator: Wolf night:

Hello wolves, I have created this new private group between wolves called "wolfs-group".

I will use this group to ask you to vote a player to eliminate every night.

Here are the alive villager players for this night: ['Chagent', 'Michael', 'Helga', 'Ling', 'Haruto', 'Jian']
WolfAlice: Who should we eliminate tonight?
Fred: text="To - Everyone| Group Message in wolf's-den: Let's go with Haruto tonight, it seems like a safer option considering Ling hasn't made any comments yet, but Haruto's name hasn't been mentioned at all, which might make their elimination less suspicious."
</pre>
